Mini Projects to Explore Deep Learning Libraries

1.Exploring NumPy and Matplotlib:

Developed three simple projects to demonstrate the features and capabilities of NumPy and Matplotlib.
Projects include data manipulation and visualization tasks to illustrate the use of these essential libraries in deep learning.
ImageGenerator Project:

2. Designed a project named ImageGenerator focused on image processing.
Tasks include loading images in JSON format, batching them, performing preprocessing steps, and displaying the processed images.
